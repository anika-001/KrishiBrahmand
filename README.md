<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


The problem Krishi Brahmand solves
There is an absence of an application that connects consumers with farmers in a transparent and direct manner. Hence, we decided to build an application connecting farmers with consumers facilitating the chain of buying and selling.
Krishi Brahmand with its main motto of “Fresh from Farm to Plate” achieves the goal of providing farmers with better opportunities to showcase their produce and pocket a higher remuneration. Its main aim is to do away with the several layers of middlemen between the farmer and the consumer. The project allows farmers to upload details, view product statistics, track various shipments and pickups of orders and receive payment online.
The ease of transaction and the sheer availability of choices alone ensures a wide user reach. This in turn assists farmers in increasing their profit just at the click of a button. Along with these functionalities Krishi Brahmand also provides farmers with a safe space to educate themselves on Government schemes and receive the appropriate assistance they require.
Thus, this project aims to help farmers achieve their true potential without the need of being dependent on intermediaries.
